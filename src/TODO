TODO
The initializing of Typedcoreir modules is so hacky. I am calling base class constructor then deleting the new'd thing, then newing my own thing.

Change isType to isKind. in general change type->kind


TODO Type::sel. What should it do for a bad select?

Module:
  Data ->
    Verilog
    Simulate
    Driver
    OtherData
  Circuit stuff

Verilog creation/lowering



Primitives TODO:
-Add generators for constants
-And all other normal primitives


TODO Possibly should check for cases of modules instantiated in its own module; "recursion"
