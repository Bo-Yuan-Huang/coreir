LLVM Compiler passes
Module (Set of functions)

List of passes I want to do
Compute Verilog: Modules -> Verilog
Requires?
Looping over every Module in the minimized dag

VerilogPass : Module Pass
  map<string,string> Mod2Verilog
  bool runonModule(Module m) {
    if (namespace==stdlib) {

    }
    else if

  }
  string instance2verilog

Run Generators Pass
RunAllGenerators : Module Pass
  

Inline Pass


Add Clock enable pass
ClockEn : ComputeDAG
  runOnModule(Module m) {
    foreach instance {
      if instance has clk
        if has clk en
          add And gate
          Wire output of And to instance.clken
        if no clk en
          instance -> instance with clken
      Wire self.clken -> inst.clken
    }
  }

OR

ClockEN : ComputeDag
  string clken
  runOnModule(Module m) {
    foreach instance with clock
      replace instRef with clkEnGen(instRef)
      Wire m.clken to inst.clken
    }
  }
}

clkEnGen(ModuleDef def, Module mref,Type tref) {
  

}



Add4 -> G(Add2)

Types of passes:

Module Pass
Runs over the modules in arbitrary order
bool runPass(Module m)

computeDAG
Run over Modules in DAG sorted order, bottom up

Instance Pass
Run over all instances in all DAGs in any order.
Is this useful?




General Ideas

For the compilers Have a set of graph editing operations
First is basically replace moduleDef with new moduleDef

//Fundemental
AddNode
DeleteNode(Deletes dangling wires)
AddWire
DeleteWire
Change NodeType (also provide mappings from old wirepaths to new wirepaths)
  //This should default to the same wirepaths if matching.
Change NodeModuleRef
Run Generator
Change genargs
Change configargs

//Helpers
splitedge(edge), Adds a node on an edge between the nodes


Maybe do Typechecking based on moduleDef, and always call when you add the definition to the module

Maybe do flatten on instances within a moduleDef. 

Have ArgNull type
Maybe have default args somehow? That would be nice
Have the Args be references rather than pointers. Can construct normally on stack without helper functions

Change Error handling to do something like LLVM where they return an Error type that you can derefence to get the return value. 

Known Bugs

Lenny TODO
  Maybe other python convenience functions for traversing the graph. We need to make sure that Caleb can use these functions.

  We need to figure out how to nicely pass errors to python
  Right now I store all errors in the context.
  I can check if I have an error with c.hasError(), and print with c.printErrors()
  Right now I was thinking of just passing an err Bool* to check, and if you want the error message, you call c->printErrors(). 
  I could definitely be persuaded on a different way. 

  (Lower priority)
  I want to have file names and line numbers for the C/Python API. This might be a tad annoying to add them back to all the C function calls, but I think there is a way in python to dynamically get this info. Alternatively we could just concatinate the linenumbers to the error message within python

Ross TODO


Change hash/eq functors to use std::function

Make sure I can include coreir.hpp instead of context.hpp
Check if I can just convert myPair to inherit from std::pair

Get Verilog codegen working again

When instantiating generators, if the typegen function exists, run it
and cache the type in the typegenInst. Does this mean I need a 'strip' function?

Generate unique name for generated modules
Make sure you cannot create two namespaces of the same name
Make sure you cannot create two Instantiables of the same name

Test out weird Named cases for loading json: Named(libA,Named(libB,Named(libC)))

change makefile to work with Clang

Metadata
  Augment function calls/constructors to use metadata

Should check for cases of modules instantiated in its own module. We dont want module "recursion"
This should be thought of as a DAG of module hierarchy. Generators can be cyclic, but Modules cannot be
