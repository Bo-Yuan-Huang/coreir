  ID: 2
  Description:
    Valgrind complains of unitialized values on ModuleDef.wire() (specifically connections.insert)
    Probably has something to do with copy constructor semantics. does not cause noticeable failures... yet
  Person: Ross

Lenny TODO
  Add Following functions to C interface and Python interface
    DONE ModuleDef.getConnections() //Get all the Wireable* Wireable* pairs 
        TODO test (Blocked until Ross fleshes out problems with ModuleDef.connections)

  Maybe other python convenience functions for traversing the graph. We need to make sure that Caleb can use these functions.

  We need to figure out how to nicely pass errors to python
  Right now I store all errors in the context.
  I can check if I have an error with c.hasError(), and print with c.printErrors()
  Right now I was thinking of just passing an err Bool* to check, and if you want the error message, you call c->printErrors(). 
  I could definitely be persuaded on a different way. 

  (Lower priority)
  I want to have file names and line numbers for the C/Python API. This might be a tad annoying to add them back to all the C function calls, but I think there is a way in python to dynamically get this info. Alternatively we could just concatinate the linenumbers to the error message within python

Ross TODO

Write a pass that returns a dependency list

Reader/Writer
  Reader Does not do any generators yet.
  Writer Does not do any typegen stuff yet.

Metadata
  Augment function calls/constructors to use metadata

Get Verilog codegen working again

Think about renaming TypeGen and TypeGenInst to NamedType
Have Type associated with TypeGenInst which is like a cache

When instantiating generators, if the typegen function exists, run it
and cache the type in the typegenInst. Does this mean I need a 'strip' function?

When Generating Modules, prepend lib name in front of module name
Make sure you cannot create two namespaces of the same name
Make sure you cannot create two Instantiables of the same name

change makefile to work with Clang

Add stream operator to Error so I can do
  Error e;
  e << "blah" << type << blah

Should check for cases of modules instantiated in its own module. We dont want module "recursion"
